# BMI Calculator

BMI Calculator for Android and IOS using React Native. I have created this app for learning the basics of React Native. Basically I converted an application written in Kotlin. It is my first practice app utilizing many features from React Native and Expo such as:

- Localization support for some languages using custom hook
- Custom components using React Native core components i.e. View, Text, TextInput and Pressable
- Some components from expo like StatusBar and LinearGradient

## Features

- BMI Calculation and classification
- Language support for English, Urdu, French, Spanish, Portuguese
- Screen Navigation using stack navigation from react-navigation
- Zustand for state management
- Typescript for type safety
- Cross platform

## Todo

- [ ] Implement dropdown for selecting field units
